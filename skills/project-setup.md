name: project-setup
description: Interactive project bootstrapper. Asks high-signal questions, infers stack, researches current tools via a subagent, validates compatibility, then outputs GitHub issues or a SETUP.md checklist.

## When to use this skill

Use when starting a brand new project from scratch and you want a researched, compatible tool list with GitHub issues to work through.

Do NOT use when adding a single library to an existing project or when you already have your full stack decided.

**What you'll need:** `git` installed, `gh` CLI installed and authenticated, a GitHub account. context7 MCP is optional but improves doc quality during installation steps.

**Announce:** "I'm using the project-setup skill to bootstrap your project. Let me run a few quick checks first."

---

## Pre-flight Checks

Run ALL of these before asking any questions.

### 1. git

```bash
git --version
```

If the command fails:
> "git is not installed. Please install it first (https://git-scm.com), then re-run this skill."

Stop. Do not continue until git is available.

### 2. gh CLI

```bash
which gh
```

If not found:
> "The GitHub CLI (`gh`) is not installed. You'll need it to create the repo and issues.
> Install: `brew install gh` (macOS) or visit https://cli.github.com
> Then run: `gh auth login`
> Let me know when you're done."

Wait for user confirmation before continuing.

```bash
gh auth status
```

If not authenticated:
> "`gh` is installed but not authenticated. Run `gh auth login` then let me know."

Wait for confirmation before continuing.

### 3. context7

Ask the user (AskUserQuestion):
- Question: "Is the context7 MCP server installed in your Claude Code setup? It gives me access to live library docs during installation steps."
- Options: Yes / No / Not sure

Store the answer as `context7_available`. Treat "not sure" as no.

### 4. GitHub repo

Ask using AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "Would you like me to create a GitHub repository for this project now?"
- Options: Yes, create it now / Skip for now (output will be SETUP.md only)

If yes:
- Ask repo name (open text)
- Ask visibility: Public / Private
- Run: `gh repo create <name> --<public|private> --clone`
- If the command fails, show the full error output and ask the user to resolve it before continuing.
- If skipped: set output format to SETUP.md only (no GitHub Issues option later).
